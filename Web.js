    1) Your browser "resolves" the name into an IP address using DNS
2) Your browser makes a request to that IP address, including headers(infor about browser, any previous cookies and other things)
3) The server sends a response(typcially HTML with a status code(200 if it was successful))
4) The browser makes a DOM from that HTML, and finds any other resources needed(images, CSS, JavaScript...etc)
5) The browser makes seperate HTTP requests for those resources and receives response from the server for each
